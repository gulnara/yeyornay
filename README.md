I built this app in order to play with sinatra framework.

If you want to know how you did on your last interview and you do not want to send a boring email, you can use this app. You will need to clone repo, change email settings to yours and modify whatever else you want.

The app is built with:

* sinatra 
* pony gem that powers sending emails (https://github.com/benprew/pony)
* SMTP is configured with mandrill (http://mandrill.com/)
* contact form is written in CSS, no jQuery or javascript is used, hence two forms - the idea was taken from one of the codepen examples (http://codepen.io/)
* Snap.svg (http://snapsvg.io/)

Here is the app itself: http://quiet-forest-1415.herokuapp.com/
